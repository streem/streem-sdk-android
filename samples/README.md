## Android SDK Samples

Code is for sample use only.

## Running the sample

If you would like to run this code:

-   Update the Android application ID in the project build.gradle
-   Contact Streem to obtain a Streem App ID (this will be self-serve in the future).
-   After receiving your Streem App ID, update this value in the Application class (RemoteStreemExampleApplication)

### Troubleshooting

-   Verify the compile sdk version is installed from the sdk manager:
    -   SDK version 30 for RemoteStreemExample
