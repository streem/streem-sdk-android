## Android SDK Samples

### Setup

Contact Streem to obtain an App ID (this will be self-serve in the future).

Create a `secrets.properties` file with your `streemAppId` in it:

**secrets.properties:**

```
    streemAppId=YOUR_APP_ID_HERE
```

You should now be able to open `samples` in Android Studio and run on device.
